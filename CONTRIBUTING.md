Contributions are **welcome**.

Please read and understand the contribution guide before creating an issue or pull request.

## Requirements

If the project maintainer has any additional requirements, you will find them listed here.

- **[PSR Coding Standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/tree/master/accepted)** - The easiest way to apply the conventions is to install [PHP Code Sniffer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer).
- **[Use Git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow#:~:text=The%20overall%20flow%20of%20Gitflow,branch%20is%20created%20from%20main&text=When%20a%20feature%20is%20complete%20it%20is%20merged%20into%20the,branch%20is%20created%20from%20main)**
- **Add tests!** - Your patch won't be accepted if it doesn't have tests.
- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.
- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.
- **Comments** - Follow (PSR-5: PHPDoc)[https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/phpdoc.md] and (PSR-19: PHPDoc tags)[https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/proposed/phpdoc-tags.md]

**Happy coding**!
